This repository contains models and code for generating different object, location and action labels from voice commands.

Use python train.py for training the model

Use python evaluation.py for generate accuracy results.

Use comfig.py files to give appropriate input and output locations.

A sequential model is trained for the three classes and their trained model is available in the task_data folder.

Checkpoint1 : action model

Checkpoint 2: object model

Checkpoint3 : location model
